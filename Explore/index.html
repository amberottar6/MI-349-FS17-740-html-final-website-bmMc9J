   "I went on this space adventure in 2016 for 8 months. We left the lauchpad in Florida on May 27th and traveled with 3 others into space. It was a 240 day expedition to our space station that we have stationed in space back in 2010. We reached the satellite after 24 days of traveling and immediatly had to make repairs. There was a severe leak that took several days to patch and return the oxygen levels to normal. We were stuck in our space suits the entire time we did repairs but once things were settled it was safe to remove our helmets-luckily too because we were running out of oxygen!- and we got to work, the reason we went in the first place. Looking for Life elsewhere in our universe!" -John Drummand, Astronaut at U.T.
